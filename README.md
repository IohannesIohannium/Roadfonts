# Road Fonts digitizations
This is a repository with digitized versions of some road fonts which are either not available on the net or are only available as paid software.

I warn you, however, that I have no font making experience, so all fine details are surely going to be wrong, no ligatures exist, and some letters may be "wobbly".

Still better, nevertheless, than having no digitized version at all, though.

The fonts featured here are:
* __Austria__, the former road font of Austria
* __KTSzB-M__, the current road font of Hungary, which is a slightly modified DIN 1451
* __Traffikalfabetet__, the current road font of Norway, which is a derivative of DIN 1451
* __Transport Eire__, the slanted variant of Transport used for Irish Gaelic text in Ireland
